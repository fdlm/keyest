This is the code used to train and evaluate the models for my paper

F. Korzeniowski and G. Widmer, “Genre-Agnostic Key Classification With Convolutional Neural Networks,” in Proceedings of the 19th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR), Paris, France, Sep. 2018.

Available [here on Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05340).

The code is provided as reference. Since everything is implemented in Theano,
Lasagne, and some internal libraries that are lost in time, you won't be able
to use it directly.

Final disclaimer: this is messy research code.
